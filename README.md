# Manager

Manager is a lightweight, adaptable project scaffold to help you start and manage small-to-medium projects quickly. It's intentionally minimal so you can easily adapt it to your preferred language, runtime, or architecture.

## About

This repository provides a clean, opinionated starting point for projects that need a simple structure and a few conveniences to accelerate development. Use it as a template for applications, libraries, or tooling across Node, Python, Go, or other ecosystems.

## Features

- Small, well-documented scaffold
- Clear README and contributor guidance
- Placeholders for config, environment, and examples
- Easy to adapt for different runtimes and workflows

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Git
- The runtime or toolchain for your project (Node, Python, Go, etc.)
- Optional: Docker for containerized development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/sfawcett123/manager2.git
2. Enter the project directory
   cd manager2
3. Install dependencies (if applicable)
   - Node (npm): npm install
   - Node (yarn): yarn
   - Python: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Go: go mod download

Adjust the commands above to match the specific language or runtime you choose to use in this scaffold.

### Run

Start the project using the appropriate command for your stack:

- Node: npm start or node ./src/index.js
- Python: python main.py
- Go: go run ./cmd/...

Add or replace the run command above with your project's actual entrypoint.

## Configuration

Store environment-specific configuration in files not tracked by source control. Suggested files:

- .env — environment variables
- .env.example — example variables for onboarding
- config.yml / config.json — application configuration (optional)

Example .env.example:
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info

Add instructions here for how to create or populate secrets and config for your environment.

## Development

- Create a feature branch for each change:
  git checkout -b feat/your-feature
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write tests for new behavior and bug fixes
- Run your test suite and linters before opening a PR

Common commands:
- Run tests: npm test | pytest | go test ./...
- Lint: npm run lint | flake8 | golangci-lint run

Consider adding CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) to automate tests and checks.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A simple flow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feat/your-feature)
3. Commit changes with clear messages
4. Push and open a pull request describing your change
5. Address review feedback and update the PR as needed

Please open an issue first for larger or breaking changes to discuss design and approach.
